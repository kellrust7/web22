    <h2>Topic 1: Mead - A History & Guide</h2>
    <h3>I have a couple of friends who make and sell homemade mead, and are even having their products packaged to be sold in stores. When I tried mead for the first time (their homemade mead), it was sweet and smooth - very enjoyable! Everyone knows about whiskies, rums, vodkas, beers, wines, etc., but what about mead? Like many, I had never even heard of it until just recently. So, the goal of this webpage is to give mead a moment in the spotlight. Here are my hero and section ideas:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Hero: Illustration/image & quick blurb (above, in progress)</li>
    <li>Section 1: What is mead? What is it made of and how is it made (process): a step-by-step</li>
    <li>Section 2: A brief history of mead: a story</li>
    <li>Section 3: Types of meads: a glossary & guide</li>
    <li>Section 4: How/where is mead most relevant today?</li>
    <li>Section 5: Well-known meaderies/establishments: a list</li>
		</ul>
		<br>





		<h2>Topic 2: The History of School Lunches</h2>
    <h3>Meals in general were quite different in the past, especially in terms of accessibility to food products, as well as the types of jobs people had. Since in the 19th and 20th centuries more families were living in rural farmland areas, meals were able to be had at home during the workday. Lunch, used interchangeably with “supper” back then, was actually the most significant meal of the day, compared to dinner now.</h3>

		<h2>Topic 3 - Polar Night & Midnight Sun (in the spirit of winter)</h2>
    <h3>Recently I learned about an interesting phenomenon in the northern hemisphere known as polar night, as well as its counterpart midnight sun. During the winter in far northern countries like Norway and Sweden, sunlight doesn’t reach the land at all because of the tilt of the Earth. This can last for months during the wintertime, resulting in a permanent night! On the other side of this coin, during the summer the sun never fully sets. This means that at 2am it will still be bright outside!</h3>
