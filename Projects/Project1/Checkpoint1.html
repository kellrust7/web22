    <h2>Topic 1: Mead - A History & Guide</h2>
    <h3>I have a couple of friends who make and sell homemade mead, and are even having their products packaged to be sold in stores. When I tried mead for the first time (their homemade mead), it was sweet and smooth - very enjoyable! Everyone knows about whiskies, rums, vodkas, beers, wines, etc., but what about mead? Like many, I had never even heard of it until just recently. So, the goal of this webpage is to give mead a moment in the spotlight. Here are my hero and section ideas:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Hero: Illustration/image & quick blurb (above, in progress)</li>

    <li>Section 3: Types of meads: a glossary & guide</li>
    <li>Section 4: How/where is mead most relevant today?</li>

		<h2>Topic 2: The History of School Lunches</h2>
    <h3>Meals in general were quite different in the past, especially in terms of accessibility to food products, as well as the types of jobs people had. Since in the 19th and 20th centuries more families were living in rural farmland areas, meals were able to be had at home during the workday. Lunch, used interchangeably with “supper” back then, was actually the most significant meal of the day, compared to dinner now.</h3>
